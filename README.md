# Analysis-ZOOM-Poll-Reports


ZOOM Polls are used frequently in lessons. The trainer can download the post-meeting survey report in csv format. These survey reports need to be processed and students graded in a survey. When given the right choices of questions for which you need to give a detailed report to the instructor on how each student performed on the exam and on each question, a survey report is provided, which should be processed in this file. Furthermore, there is a need to monitor students' performance in various questionnaires throughout the semester.
